# Numbble

Numbble is an engaging math puzzle game where players create valid equations using numbers and operations. It's a fun way to practice math skills while challenging yourself to find creative solutions.

## How to Play

### Game Objective
Create a valid mathematical equation using the provided numbers and operations. You'll need to strategically place operations between numbers to make a mathematically correct equation.

### Game Elements

- **Number Tiles**: Fixed tiles containing single or multi-digit numbers.
- **Operation Tiles**: Drag or click to place these between numbers.
  - Basic operations: Addition (`+`), Subtraction (`-`), Multiplication (`×`), Division (`÷`)
  - Advanced operations: Square (`²`), Square Root (`½`)
  - Equals sign (`=`) to separate both sides of your equation
- **Bracket Tiles**: Add parentheses to control the order of operations.
- **Decimal Point**: Create decimal numbers for more solution possibilities.

### Controls

- **Mouse/Touch**: Drag and drop operations and brackets onto the board, or click them and then click where you want to place them.
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**:
  - `Enter`: Check your equation
  - `r`: Reset the current board
  - `s`: Skip to a new board with different numbers
  - `Arrow keys`: Navigate through available operations
  - `Space`: Place the selected operation

### Scoring System

- Each operation has a point value:
  - Addition/Subtraction: 5 points
  - Multiplication/Division: 10 points
  - Square: 15 points
  - Square Root: 20 points
  - Decimal Point: 25 points

- **Time Bonuses**:
  - Solve in under 15 seconds: 2× score multiplier
  - Solve in under 60 seconds: 1.5× score multiplier

- **Session Score**: The game tracks your cumulative score across multiple games, displayed in the top-right corner.

### Tips for Success

1. Look for multiple solutions - there's often more than one way to solve a board.
2. Use brackets strategically to control the order of operations.
3. Consider using the square and square root operations for higher scores.
4. Try to use all available numbers in your equation for a bonus.
5. If you're stuck, don't hesitate to use the Skip button to try a new board.
